/*
The Project window showing the course structure
on the left and the Task window on the right are
called tool windows. You can adjust their size by clicking on the
boundary and moving it. You can temporarily hide the tool window from the view
to make better use of the screen: click the "hide" button in the top right
corner of the tool window. To see it again, choose its name by clicking on the
right or left side of the screen or by choosing it in the
View | Tool Windows application menu.
Hide the Task tool window and then open it again.
